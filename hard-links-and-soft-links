*	Hard links	*
	You can think a hard link as an additional name for an existing file.
	Hard links are associating two or more file names with the same inode . You can create one or more hard links for a single file.
	Hard links cannot be created for directories and files on a different filesystem or partition.

*	Soft links	*
	A soft link is something like a shortcut in Windows. It is an indirect pointer to a file or directory. Unlike a hard link,
	a symbolic link can point to a file or a directory on a different filesystem or partition.
